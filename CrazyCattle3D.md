### **Game Overview**  
• **Genre**: Physics-driven battle royale (currently single-player vs AI, multiplayer under consideration)  
• **Theme**: Strategic sheep combat with explosive abilities and dark humor  
• **Platform**: Browser-based (PC only; mobile unsupported)  
• **Development**: Indie passion project, skill-based progression, no pay-to-win elements

### **Core Features**  
1. **Physics-Driven Gameplay**  
   • *Momentum Mechanics*: Slope acceleration, collision angles, and terrain deformation  
   • *Emergent Chaos*: Unpredictable outcomes from ragdoll physics and environmental interactions  
   • *Precision Controls*: WASD movement + mouse steering + timed spacebar explosions  

2. **Tactical Maps**  
   | **Location**   | **Terrain**                     | **Key Strategies**                  |  
   |----------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|  
   | **Ireland**     | Rolling hills                   | Ramp jumps for aerial assaults      |  
   | **Iceland**     | Volcanic hazards                | Lure enemies into lava traps        |  
   | **New Zealand** | Vertical mountains              | High-ground ambushes & evasion      |  

3. **Pure Skill Competition**  
   • *No RNG*: Wins determined solely by physics mastery (no loot/upgrades)  
   • *Steep Learning Curve*: 30-minute matches demand mastery of advanced techniques:  
     ◦ *Slingshot Maneuver*: Downhill speed → sharp directional change  
     ◦ *Battering Ram*: Perfectly timed collision knockouts  
   • *Community-Driven Rankings*: Player-organized tournaments and prestige systems

### **New Player Guide**  
1. **Basic Mechanics**  
   • *Movement*: Combine slope momentum with abrupt stops for surprise attacks  
   • *Critical Skill*: Spacebar explosions require <0.5s timing for max knockback  
   • *Early Game*: Scout choke points; *Late Game*: Aggressive terrain manipulation  

2. **Performance Tips**  
   • Reduce lag: Lower graphics settings, close background apps  
   • Anti-motion sickness: Increase FOV, take 5-minute breaks hourly  
   • Observation Mode: Study AI pathing post-death to learn map exploits

### **Unique Selling Points (vs Traditional Battle Royale)**  
| **Aspect**       | **Typical BR Games**           | **Crazy Cattle 3D**                |  
|--------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
| **Victory Condition** | Weapon RNG + aim skill       | Terrain IQ + physics prediction   |  
| **Humor Factor**   | Serious tone                  | Self-yeeting sheep slapstick      |  
| **Accessibility**  | Complex inventory management  | WASD + mouse fundamentals         |  
| **Fairness**       | Loot-dependent early game     | Pure mechanics from match start    |

### **Development Opportunities**  
• **Technical**: Optimize physics engine for multi-sheep collisions  
• **Content**: Add weather effects (e.g., Irish rain affecting traction)  
• **Community**: Implement built-in ELO rankings and replay sharing  
• **QoL**: Add tutorial challenges (e.g., "Launch 3 sheep off cliffs in 10s")
